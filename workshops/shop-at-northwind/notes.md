- API is already setup on your computer at `learntocode\northwind-workshop-express-server`

## API Setup

The [Backend API is in this repository](https://github.com/DevelopIntelligenceBoulder/northwind-workshop-express-server.git), but you should have it cloned (downloaded on your computer already)

1. Find `learntocode\northwind-workshop-express-server` in Windows Explorer or Finder (Mac)
2. Right click and choose `open git bash here` or `open terminal in folder` depending on operating system.
3. Run the command:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
4. Leave that terminal window up and running
